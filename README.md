❓❗️ Who am I?
I am a **Sr. Developer Advocate** at Amazon Web Services (AWS).

I am here to share my experiences on building architectures with best practices, and help strengthen builders of tomorrow.

I have over a decade of experience in IT industry, primarily focusing on Cloud Computing technologies. With AWS since January 2014, I have worked on multiple roles including being a Solutions Architect (SA) in ASEAN & India. As a SA I focused on the needs of cloud native customers. I have been leading conversations with businesses of all industries and sizes on innovation, as they deploy critical workloads onto the cloud. 
I frequently speak at conferences, meetups and mentor aspiring women in tech.
